# **VillagersRevenge**
My College School Project and first Game I created from scratch using the Unity game engine and Blender for the models. This game invovles basic random level generation using different room templates, which the loading system will randomly select one these templates and place the rooms entry point onto an exit point which each room template has.

# **How to play**

<h3>Download</h3>
<p class="padded">
First you go to the release page on my github and download the most recent version of the Villagers Revenge, extract the files in the zip file anywhere on your computer, open the folder called "Built Game" and run "Villagers Revenge.exe". You will then be greeted with the Unity Configuration screen where you can change any settings that you wish to change such as graphics or inputs.

<h3>Movement</h3>
<p class="padded">
The defult movement keys are 'W A S D' or the arrow keys to move your character. 'W' moves the character up and 'A' moves the           character right and so on.
</p>

<h3>Inventory</h3>
<p class="padded">
When you are in game press the "tab" key to open the Inventory, here you can store and move items between the different slots in the     inventory. To store an item in you inventory you must first find an item you can pick up such as a rock or stick found in the           multiple different rooms by walking up to it and pressing 'E' to pick it up. Once you have an item in your inventory you can click on   the item in your inventory and move it between the different slots. You can also drop items on the floor by clicking on an item in       your inventory and closing the inventory screen causing the item to be dropped onto the floor.
</p>

**Note there are only 2 types of items that can be found in the dugeon, and dropping items from your inventory may cause the items scale to change due to a bug as of V1.0**

<h3>Crafting</h3>
<p class="padded">
Once you have found and stored a rock and stick in your inventory you can craft a stone club using the crafting section to the right     of the inventory labeled "Crafting" you must place both the items in one of the 3 slots located above the one large slot at the bottom   of the crafting section then you will be given the option to craft a stone club in the large result slot at the bottom. You can         complete the crafting process by clicking on the stone club which upon doing so the club will be crafted and be able to drop and place   the items used to craft it will be destroyed.
</p>

**Note the stone club is the only craftable weapon as of V1.0**

<h3>Combat</h3>
<p class="padded">
To fight back against the enemies in the dungeon you will need a equip a weapon. To do so simply open your inventory with the "Tab" key click on the weapon to pick it up with your cursor and click on the weapon slot located at the top right of the screen to equip the weapon and use it. Once the weapon is equiped you can close the inventory with either "Tab" or "esc" and left click to swing your weapon. Make sure your character is facing towards and enemy when you swing to hit it.
  
Dont forget that you also have health. You can see how much health you have by looking at the top left of the screen to see you Health bar the green indicates how much Health you have left. If you run out of health your character dies and you lose the game.
</p>

**Note hitting enemies is rather difficult with the current movement system as of V1.0**
